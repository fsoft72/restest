# restest
Scriptable REST calls test software written in Python

`restest` actions are defined inside a JSON file.

## JSON file structure

This is the smaller JSON file for `restest` you can write
(note: name it `simple-example.test.json`):
```
{
	"actions": [
		{
			"method": "get",
			"url": "/api/your/url/hello-world"
		}
	]
}
```

In this example, the JSON file is created with just one single action that will do a GET request to the `/api/your/url/hello-world` URI.
As you can see, the URI is incomplete, as it misses the `http`/`https` part. Don't worry: you can specify it in the command line.
Specifying using the command line allows you to run the same tests on different URLs (for example, development and production environments).

Here is the shortest command line to execute the script above:

```
restest --base-url http://example.com simple-example.test.json
```

Every action **must** contain a `method` or `action` key.

If the `method` key is present, then the action is actually a `http`/`https` request.

If the `action` key is present, then the action is a *script* command.


## ACTION description for HTTP requests

### `method`

Supported `method` modes:

- **GET** the `HTTP GET` method
- **POST** the `HTTP POST` method

Currently, other `HTTP` methods are not supported, but planned in the future.

### `url`

The partial URL to call. As you have seen before, you can specify the base URL with the `--base-url` command line argument.

### `params`

If the action is a `post` request, you can specify `POST` parameters with this keyword and passing an array.
Here there is an example:
```
{
	"method": "post",
	"url": "/api/site/login",
	"params": {
		"email": "john.doe@example.com",
		"password": "mypassword"
	}
}
```
